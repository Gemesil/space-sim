# space-sim
A one man made video game, current plan is to be able to explore different planets in first person and control various star systems like in a 4X game.

## Ideas
- Have different randomly generated space factions and make it so the player can have different relations with each factions or even with each region of the faction's control.
- Make it so the player can carry items and sell to dealers, maybe even invent some sort of a space drug that the player can sell for a big profit but is contraband and so he'll have to hide it(and if so - make it so there is some kind of a police force that checks inventories and maybe even a jail area if the player is caught).
- Make it so the planets spin around the center point of the star system.
- Have a ton of different planet types, if possible - make the planet types randomly generated.
